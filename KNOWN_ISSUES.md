# Kourageus Tourists /L Unleashed :: Known Issues

* The timing between the command to take the Selfie and the emotions being applied to the EVAing tourists are far from perfect, but appears to be better now (as all Kerbals were being photograged before the emotinos could be executed!)
	+ I mamaged to almost sync them with few Kerbals, but as more Kerbals are present on the Scene, more the chances of missing the emotions of most of them.
	+ A more or less workaround is to take two or tree selfies in sequence, seizing the late emotions from the last ones.
	+ Recovering the Tourists doesn't improves the timing, but changing scenario and coming back after some recoverings changes the timings.
		- Should be the same problem. 
* Only the last Tourist to had gone EVA is able to take Selfies on some undetermined conditions (probably related to an older KSP version)
	+ EDIT: Changing scenarios kinda "fix" the issue
